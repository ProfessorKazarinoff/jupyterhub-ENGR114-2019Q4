# Install JupyterHub

After the server is set up, it is time to install JupyterHub.

[TOC]

## Update System

It is probably best to update the packages installed on the server in case there are changes and updates to the operating system since the server was created. ```sudo apt-get update``` is probably a reflex for those that use Linux a lot. 

Open PuTTY and log into the server as the non-root sudo user we created in the last step. Then update the system:

```text
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Install Miniconda

Next we'll install **Miniconda**. In the last JupyterHub deployment, I installed the full version of **Anaconda** in the non-root user's home directory(```/home/peter/```). The user's home directory is the default Anaconda3 installation location. 

However, for this JupyterHub deployment, we'll install **Miniconda** in the ```/opt``` directory. The **Miniconda** install is lighter than the full **Anaconda** install, and we don't need all the GUI applications that **Anaconda** provides. The packages that we need in this deployment of JupyterHub, we can install in a seperate virtual environment. 

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-anaconda-python-distribution-on-ubuntu-16-04) from Digital Ocean.

Go to [https://repo.continuum.io/archive/](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/) and look down the list of installs for the newest installer that corresponds to:

 * Miniconda3 (not Miniconda2, we don't want legacy Python version 2.7)
 * Linux
 * x86
 * 64 (bit)
 * .sh (linux shell script)

The URL of the latest Miniconda install for Linux will look something like:

```text
https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

To downland and install Miniconda on the server, we'll use the ```curl``` command and run the bash installer from the command line:

```text
$ cd /tmp
$ curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ sudo bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

During the Miniconda install, we need to specify the following installation directory:

```text
/opt/miniconda3/
```

When the Miniconda install finished, the installer asked

```text
Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3
by running conda init? [yes|no]
```

I selected ```yes``` to run conda init.

We want to be able to run **conda** from the command line. So make sure to allow **Miniconda** to append your PATH during the installation. After installation, we need to reload the ```.bashrc``` file because **Miniconda** made changes to our ```.bashrc``` during the install (when it added **conda** to our PATH).

```text
$ cd ~
$ source .bashrc
```

When the install is complete,  look in ```/opt```, and see the ```miniconda3``` directory.

```text
$ cd /opt
$ ls
miniconda3
```

## Change Miniconda3 Permissions

Now we need to deal with some permission issues. Since I am running as the user ```peter``` on the Digital Ocean server, I need to make sure that the user ```peter``` has read, write, and execute permissions on the enitre ```/opt/miniconda3/``` directory.

We can give our ```peter``` user permissions with ```chmod``` and ```chown```.

```text
$ cd /opt
$ ls
miniconda3
$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Oct 30 04:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Oct 29 17:49 ..
drwxr-xr-x 13 root root 4096 Oct 30 04:47 miniconda3
```

Currently, the owner of the ```miniconda3``` directory is ```root``` and the group is ```root```. The owner ```root``` has read, write, execute privaleges (```rwx```) and the group ```root``` has read, execute privaleges (```r-x```), but no write prvialeges.

Let's modify the read, write, execute privaleges of the ```minconda3/``` directory so that the group ```root``` can read, write, and execute (```rwx```).

```text
$ sudo chmod -R g+w miniconda3/
$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Oct 30 04:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Oct 29 17:49 ..
drwxrwxr-x 13 root root 4096 Oct 30 04:47 miniconda3
```

OK, now let's change the group corresponding to the ```miniconda3/``` directory from ```root``` to ```peter```.

```text
$ sudo chown -R root:peter miniconda3/
$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root  4096 Oct 30 04:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root  4096 Oct 29 17:49 ..
drwxrwxr-x 13 root peter 4096 Oct 30 04:47 miniconda3
```

Now the user ```peter``` will be able to install packages using **conda** and **pip** in the miniconda3 installation in the ```/opt``` directory.

Now that the permissions are changed, we should be able to run **conda** from the command line. Try:

```
$ conda --version
```

If you see output, that means **Miniconda** was installed and **conda** can be run by the non-root user.

## Create a virtual environment and install and packages

For this JupyterHub install, we are going to create a conda environment (a virtual environment) and install packages into that environment. 

I had trouble with conda hanging during the JupterHub installation, and I wondered if it had something to do with the Anaconda installation being so large. (Really, now I think it might also have something to do with Python version 3.7). 

In a previous JupyterHub installation, when I tried to make a Python 3.7 conda environment and install JupyterHub into it, conda downgraded Python from 3.7 to 3.6. 

In Fall 2019, I am pretty sure that JupyterHub runs on Python 3.7, but I still had trouble installing conda packages into the conda environment I created based on Python 3.7. When I tried to install conda packages into the environment I recieved "can't access such and such file at .gobledegook". But when I closed the terminal, took a 5 hour break, and opened up a new terminal, I could install conda packages just fine. Maybe just logging in and out worked? I'm not really sure. 

But the conda environment was created with Python 3.7 and now I can install packages into it, so I'll count that as a win. Maybe logging out and back in does the trick.

Note: Don't forget to install **xlrd**, this package is needed for **pandas** to read ```.xlsx``` files. 

```text
$ conda create -n jupyerhubenv python=3.7
$ conda activate jupyterhubenv
(jupyterhubenv)$ conda install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy sympy seaborn bokeh holoviews pyserial xlrd jupyter notebook 
(jupyterhubenv)$ conda install -c conda-forge pint altair
(jupyterhubenv)$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
(jupyterhubenv)$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub
```

Now try ```conda list``` and see all of the packages that are installed in ```(jupyterhubenv)```.

```text
(jupyterhubenv)$ conda list
# packages in environment at /opt/miniconda3/envs/jupyterhubenv:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
_libgcc_mutex             0.1                        main
alembic                   1.0.11                     py_0    conda-forge
altair                    3.2.0                    py37_0    conda-forge
...
```

## Run a very unsecured instance of Jupyter Hub just to see if it works

So... This might not be a good idea, but let's see if JupyterHub works. We can run JupyterHub on our server, but the ufw firewall is blocking port 8000. We can open port 8000 using the command below.

```text
$ sudo ufw allow 8000
$ sudo ufw status
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
8000                       ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
8000 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

OK let's give JupyterHub a whirl. We'll start JupterHub for the first time. Note the ```--no-ssl``` flag at the end of the command. This flag needs to be included or you won't be able to browse to the server. Also note we have to be our ```(jupyterhubenv)``` virtual environment active when we run the command. 

```text
$(jupyterhubenv) jupyterhub --no-ssl
```

We see some output in the PuTTY window. The last line is something like ```JupyterHub is now running at http://:8000/```. The first time I set up JupyterHub, I wasn't able to see the site using a web browser. No web page loaded, and the connection timed out. Opening port 8000 did the trick.

Now we can browse to the server IP address of our Digital Ocean Droplet appended with ```:8000```. The web address should look something like: http://165.228.68.178:8000. You can find the IP address of the server by going into the Digital Ocean dashboard. 

The JupyterHub login screen looks like:

![jupyter hub no ssl login](images/jupyterhub_no_ssl_login.png)

Awesome! Quick log into JupyterHub using the username and password for the non-root sudo user (in my case ```peter```) that we set up and are using in our current PuTTY session. 

You should see the typical notebook file browser with all the files you can see when you run ```ls ~/```. Try creating and running a new Jupyter notebook. The notebook works just like a **Jupyter notebook running locally**.

## Quick! Log out and shut down JupyterHub

!!! warning
    <strong>Warning!</strong> You should not run JupyterHub without SSL encryption on a public network.

**Quick! Log out and shut down JupyterHub**. (does quick really matter in internet security?) The site is running without any ssl security over regular HTTP not HTTPS. Key in [Ctrl] + [c] to stop JupyterHub.

After I shut the JupyterHub instance down, I re-blocked port 8000 with the command below.

```text
$ sudo ufw deny 8000
$ sudo ufw status
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
8000                       DENY        Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
8000 (v6)                  DENY        Anywhere (v6)
```

## Next Steps

The next step is to aquire a domain name and link it to our Digital Ocean server.
