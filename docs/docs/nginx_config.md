# Nginx Configuration

The next step is to modify the Nginx config file so that Nginx uses our SSL certificates and routes requests on to JupyterHub.

## Introduction

The Nginx configuration step was the hardest part for me when I set up my first JupyterHub server. The Nginx config file isn't Python code or a bash script. I went through many different variations until I finally got a config file that worked. 

The big initial problem was that I copied the sample Nginx config that's up on the JupyterHub docs. But the Nginx config posted on the JupyterHub docs is not a complete Nginx config, it contains just the server portion. I didn't know that the whole server portion needed to be enclosed in another frame.

## Modify nginx.conf
 
To modify ```nginx.conf```, ```cd``` into the ```/etc/nginx``` directory. The ```nginx.conf``` file should be there along with a couple other files and directories.

```
$ cd /etc/nginx
$ ls
conf.d          koi-utf     nginx.conf    sites-available  ssl
fastcgi.conf    koi-win     proxy_params  sites-enabled    uwsgi_params
fastcgi_params  mime.types  scgi_params   snippets         win-utf
$ sudo nano nginx.conf
```

The nginx config that eventually worked for me is below. It can also be found [here](https://github.com/ProfessorKazarinoff/jupyterhub-ENGR114-2019Q4/blob/master/nginx.conf).

Note the line which shows the path to the SSL certificates. This will change based on your domain name and where certbot saved the .pem files to. Remember to change the domain name in the line ```server_name mydomain.org;``` to your domain name.

        }
        location ~ /.well-known {
            allow all;
        }
    }
}

```
Save and exit with [Ctrl] + [x] and [Enter]

## Restart Nginx

Now let's restart Nginx with our new configuration in place.

```text
$ sudo systemctl stop nginx
$ sudo systemctl start nginx
$ sudo systemctl status nginx
# [ctrl-c] to exit
```

If you have trouble with the restart, a useful command is:

```text
$ nginx -t
```

When we browse to our domain name, we can see Nginx is running. Make sure to browse to ```https://mydomain.org``` and not ```https://www.mydomain.org```. The cirtbot ssl cirtificut we got is only for ```https://mydomain.org``` and not the url that starts with ```www.```.

## Next Steps

The next step configure JupyterHub by creating and modifying a ```jupyterhub_config.py``` file.
